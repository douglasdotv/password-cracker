This is a password cracker written in Java intended as a solution to a Hyperskill project. The program uses a dictionary file and a brute force approach to crack passwords. During this project, I learned about the Socket class and how to use it for communication purposes. I also learned about Streams and how they are used to handle and exchange data between a server and a client.
