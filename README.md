This is a password cracker written in Java intended as a solution to a Hyperskill project. The program uses a dictionary file and a brute force approach to crack passwords. 

During this project, I learned about or practiced: 
- Java Socket class and how to use it for communication between a server and a client
- Java Streams API and how it can be used to process data with intermediate and terminal operations
- I/O streams and how to use them to exchange data between a server and a client
- Gson library and how to use it to convert Java objects to JSON and vice-versa
- Brute force algorithms
